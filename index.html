      <p class="introduction">
        <strong>Habito</strong> is an app that helps you keep track of your
        habits. You can mark down your progress daily and at the end of each
        week you will be prompted to write down how your week successes and
        struggles.
        <br />
        <br />
        The end goal is to reach 5000 points. Every sucessful day grants you a
        combo point and +10 score points, the more combo points you have, the
        more points you will receive. Inversely if you fail a day you will lose
        your combo points and start from 10 points again.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is a substantial bonus at the end of each week. You will receive a
        50% bonus from every point you've gathered/lost during that certain
        week. Additionally at the end of each month you will get a 100% bonus
        from all the points you've gathered/lost during said month.
